# I made a deal with the devil

Alright so I should explain myself:

A couple of months ago I decided I wanted to get a job as a dev as soon as possible in order to start gaining experience so that when I finish college the next year it'll be easier for me to get a job.

I had just finished a web development bootcamp and surely I thought that wasn’t enough alone to land a 5 figure job as a jr, **but it would get me somewhere**, so I started sending job requests on a lot of sites until some replied back, long story short **only one accepted me** and I had to move cities to attend their trainings in Cobol.

Sure if you ask me that was quiet a bold move to make considering the job offer could have fallen down anytime but I just wanted to get a place to start working on my internship as well since my school notified me that was coming soon, which put me under a little bit of more pressure.

>I just want to be done with school and continue learning what I see fit for my career.

Now I'm kinda stuck, at least that’s how I feel, I have 6 months to go until my internship is complete, by then I’ll be done with any school work since this is my last semester and that makes me feel anxious, the job offer they gave me was for consulting, not developing, and even tho development is part of the jobs they take I had the luck of being assign on an administrations project, my spare time as the only time I’m able to code, bummer, **I want to code**.

Also apparently they use C here, nobody told me that, had they told me I would have started learning C like 2 months ago, but here I am some freeCodeCamp videos on youtube to learn C. That would be the 2nd language I learn for this job, the first one being Cobol, and not even the newer versions, I’m talking ‘bout 74 and 85 Cobol!

Where I’m going with all of these is that I’m so close of being done and all the paperwork, the actual work, the lack of interest in the subjects I’m dealing with on a daily basis makes me doubt if the degree is worth it, I know a ton of people that don’t have a degree and that doesn’t stop them from doing great, both economically and professionally, but there are a couple of things that a degree would make easier for me and that’s what I keep reminding me of.

***“Tough times make tough men”*** as they say, *sometimes I’d like to just be a ball of fluff*, but that has no use, I’ve come a long way, made risky choices, I’ve made mistakes yet I’m still standing and moving forward, not a lot of people can say that.

The degree will only be a stepping stone in the journey, not looking forward to it, but what I can do with it, I still know I have to sharpen my tools to make it out there, that’s the fun part until the real work begins.

*Man, I'd love to be more social online and engage in other people's projects.*
