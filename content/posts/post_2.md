# What's with all the confusion?

For starters: What brings people to ask this question in the first place?

People may come to know one or both of this names for various reasons:

- Learning for IT or CS students
- Downloading some program on their computer
- Finding a place to save code related files

These are just some examples but we can see a pattern emerging here. Particularly Linux and Unix based OS users are more likely to come accross this names, this is because of the nature of these OS but Windows users will surely catch up eventually.

Let's read what each one has to say for themselves:

### Git

"Git is a a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency." *Git-scm.com*

### Github

"GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere." *Docs.Github.com*

## Did you catch that?

Both projects "handle version control" and "allow people to work on projects together", so they must do the same thing rght? Not quite.

**Git** is an open source version control system, **Github** on the other hand is a code hosting platfrom for version control.

*~ Pretty sure that's the same...*

Wrong, Git is a complex system that has allowed developers, programmers, researchers and many more to handle their files from anywhere, by a lot of people, anytime they wanted, giving them the possibility to revisit the past of their code (OMG) and work together along people around the globe. You think humans have explored only so little about the ocean? Try asking a developer how many commands git has. I know like 10 of them and it has surprised me how much I can do with them.

Here comes your son Git. Github, it's quite a likable fellow, it has a nice graphic user interface (or "GUI" as I love to say), it can do a lot of the things Git can with a familiar web page aesthetic.

```bash
Definitely easier to use for most people than some wierd commands like "commit" or "add ."
```

## It's not all about the looks

As you go deeper into the rabbit hole you'll find out how powerfull a command line is, hence it's permanence in today's technology, this is because there we are speaking a more computer like language, just about enough to ask for the right dish at a restaurant in another language and still get what you wanted to order, it allows you to be precise enough about how you want to handle your files while also giving control about where, when or who is accesing them. 

A big example of this is the Linux OS distributions, OS's that are being supported by people around the world which can handle themselves with just two commands that will get you and upgrade every update available for the files in your computer, a simple yet powerful example of what distributed open source can do, this of course applies to smaller projects, like your rock, paper & scissors game in C, everything can be handled with version control.

## Green suits you

Such a nice color, when we see it it always mean good news: You passed your tests, your pull requests where approved, it really does mean life and github knows it.

The strength in Github lies in  it's visual impact: Comments, repositories, organizations, issues, discussions, all forms of communication wich with time has grown into a vast community of people of all kind. It really show the live component of technology: People

## They're not the same, got you

Yeah, they are different projects but both their missions are to help people thru technology, and just like people they are stronger together, each have strenghts and weakness, different learning curves (heads up: git is way longer) but it's just a matter of experience to get the hang of it, just go one step at a time.

As Charlie Mackesy  wrote in The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse.

"I can't see a way through," said the boy. "**Can you see your next step?**" "Yes." "**Just take that**" said the horse."
