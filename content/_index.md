## The fabulous adventures of a caffeinated man
Alejandro Garcia AKA Lex / Burst / Burstniart

- I'm into web development, learning the secrets from JavaScript, more into React and Vue.

- Current internship working with C, still learning it, Cobol (not a big fan).

- Know the basics of Java and Python, definitely will stretching Python with the studies in data science than I'm planning by the  end of 2022.

- Right know I'm new to the whole GNU/Linux world but this has changed my focus towards open source code and collaborating.
